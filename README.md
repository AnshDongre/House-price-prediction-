# House-price-prediction-
This is a python model which helps to predict the price of house using various factors such as no. of bedrooms area of house and age of house .
Steps involved :
1.Data exploration is done on given test dataset to find out which model is best and the outcome was to use mulitple linear regression here we've one dependent factor and three independent factors.
2.The data exploration is done using matplotlib which basically draws a graph and on the behaviour of the graph one can decide which model is most accurate.
3.In this model we've used the sklearn library from which we've used the linear regression model.
4.The data set is present in .csv format from that data we train our model .
 Getting started with project:
 You just need to have python and anocanda on your machine.
 Try to use it on Jupyter notebook.
